Rest Server
This application facilitates and manages human resources. Its purpose is to create, maintain and store employee data. There are restrictions on access and user rights.

For the purposes of this demo, the project runs as a REST server, communicating via REST requests with https://github.com/mr-pachev/human-resource-managements.git, which runs as a REST client.
